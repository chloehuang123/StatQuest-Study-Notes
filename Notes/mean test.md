# One Sample Student's t-test (z-test if we know the population standard deviation)

Tests whether an unknown populaton mean is different from a specific value

* H0: the popluation mean is equal (or less than and equal) (or greater than and equal) to some specific value
* H1: the population mean is not equal (or greater than) (or less than) to the specific value in H0

# Two Sample Student's t-test

Tests whether the population means of two independent samples are significantly different.

* H0: the means of the samples are equal.
* H1: the means of the samples are unequal.

Tests whether the population means of two or more independent samples are significantly different.

* H0: the means of the samples are equal.
* H1: at least one of the means of the samples are unequal
