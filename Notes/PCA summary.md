* Pinciple Component Analysis is a dimensionality reduction method
* Each Principle Component is a linear combination of all the variables in a dataset
* Pinciple Components are independent with each other
* PCA Procedure:
    1. Standardization of original dataset (same scaling for each variable)
    2. Calculate the Covariance Matrix
    3. Calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors
    4. Rank these eigenvectors in order of eigenvalues, and make scree plot
    5. Build the feature matrix, and make the dataset transformation
