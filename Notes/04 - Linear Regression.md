# Linear Regression 5 Assumptions

1. Linearity
The relationship between the independent and dependent variables must be linear.  It is also important to check for outliers since linear regression is sensitive to outlier effects.  The linearity assumption can best be tested with scatter plots, and it can be measured by pearson correlation coefficient 

Note: if pearson correlation coefficient is 0, it only means that there is no linear relationship between two variables, but these two variables may have some non-linear relationship.

3. Homoscedasticity
4. Independence
5. Normality
6. No Multicollinearity
